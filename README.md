## Rails base app

This repo is containing a blank rails application using postgreSQL and React.

Versions :

-   Rails 7.0.3.1
-   Ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [arm64-darwin21]

## How to build React

```
npm run build
```

This command will build JS (we should add this step to the onSave event to have a hot reloading)
